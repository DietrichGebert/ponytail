    'security measures, accessibility basics, the calibration real hardware needs (the platform is never the spec ideal), anything the user explicitly asked to keep. ' +
    'Lazy code without its check is unfinished: non-trivial logic leaves ONE runnable check behind (assert-based demo/self-check or one small test file; no frameworks). Trivial one-liners need no test.\n\n' +
