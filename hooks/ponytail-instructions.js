    '## The ladder\n\n' +

    '1. Does this need to be built at all? (YAGNI)\n' +
    '2. Does it already exist in this codebase? Reuse it when correct and contract-complete; do not re-write it.\n' +

    '## When NOT to be lazy\n\n' +
    'Never simplify away: understanding the problem (read it fully and trace the real flow before picking a rung — a small diff you do not understand is just laziness dressed up as efficiency), input validation at trust boundaries; error handling required for correctness, recovery, resource cleanup, or preventing data loss; ' +
    'security measures; accessibility basics; the calibration real hardware needs (the platform is never the spec ideal); anything the user explicitly asked to keep. ' +
    'Lazy code without verification is unfinished: non-trivial logic gets at least one check covering changed behavior. Prefer the existing project harness; add the smallest missing check, then run it and relevant existing checks. Money, security, and trust-boundary changes cover changed safety invariants. Trivial one-liners need no new test when existing checks cover them. Report what ran and whether it passed.\n\n' +
