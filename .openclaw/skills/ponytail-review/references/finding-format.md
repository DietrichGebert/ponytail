# Finding format (shared by ponytail-review and ponytail-audit)

Very simple English: short sentences, everyday words. Explain a technical
term the first time you use it. The reader may never have seen this code.

Group findings in three buckets, skip empty groups:
- **Must fix:** bug, security, data loss, breaks at the expected load.
- **Should fix:** risky code without a test, real slowness, duplication, a
  function that mixes jobs, code that should not exist.
- **Nice to have:** small speed-ups, shorter forms.

Number findings across all groups, so the user can say "fix 2 and 5".
Every finding has all four parts, each one or two short sentences:

2. **Orders land on the wrong day** (`billing/close_day.py:L40-52`)
   - **What this is:** At midnight this job closes the day and bills all orders of that day.
   - **Problem:** It takes "today" from the server clock, which runs in UTC. An order placed
     at 00:30 in Berlin is billed on the day before.
   - **Fix:** Compute the day once in the shop's time zone:
     `datetime.now(ZoneInfo("Europe/Berlin")).date()`. One line, nothing else changes.
   - **If we skip it:** Late orders show the wrong date, and accounting fixes them by hand.
